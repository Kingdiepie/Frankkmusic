							<p>"The Frank K Band is terrific and so is the Frank K Duo. Fran has a great voice and the audience loves it when she comes out on the floor and sings for them or lets them join in. It is easy to tell that you and your band are professionals and enjoy providing entertainment.</p><p>
Frank, you are so good about all the details-contract, setting up, playing someone's favorite tune, playing just one more song, and always ending with a patriotic song. Your price is very fair and once you are booked, I never have to worry about a thing. I know you will be there, on time, and with a smile on your face. We look forward to your next performance and know it will be the best!"</p>

It is always a pleasure to work with you!"</p>
